- 👋 Hi, I’m @FireCat16, but you can call me Ana. I'm a junior pursuing a bachelors in computer science!
- 👀 Although I'm still exploring the broad field of CS, what interests me currently is graphics & visual computing, 
software engineering and information management/data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will widen my perspective of the field and help me gain experience.
